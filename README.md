## Introduction

Many embedded systems are deployed in places that are difficult or impractical for a human operator to access. This is especially true for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which are typically deployed in larger quantities and with limited battery life. Some examples would be embedded systems that monitor the health of a person or a machine. 

These challenges, coupled with the rapid software lifecycle, cause many systems to require support for over-the-air (OTA) updates.An OTA update replaces the software on the microcontroller or microprocessor of the embedded system with new software.

## Project Description

The Project is mainly targeting to upgrade the firmware of remote Hardware ECUs OTA (Over the air). The project is an initalization phase to create a portable, configurable platform to update remotely ECUs with different methods and Hardware. 

## Project Overview

This Project was divided into 3 main sections:
1. **User GUI**
2. **Gateway Network**
3. **Target Hardware Firmware**
